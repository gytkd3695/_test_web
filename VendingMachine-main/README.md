# VendingMachineAssignment
This assignment was an assessment where I had to demonstrate my proficiency with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and REST APIs by building a dynamic user-interface consuming a REST API.  Using the wireframe provided we had to make a fully functional vending machine web page.
